# Reviewing Pull Requests

## When to use
Use this skill for PR readiness reviews before human approval.

## Preconditions
- Repository / PR is accessible.
- Read-only inspection is sufficient.
- If REQUIREMENTS.md or SPEC.md exists, use it as normative context.

## Workflow
1. Identify the PR / branch / diff to review.
2. Read project-level instructions and relevant requirements/specification.
3. Inspect changed files and map them to the requested behavior.
4. Inspect or run relevant tests.
5. Apply `references/review_checklist.md`.
6. Classify findings using `references/severity_guide.md`.
7. Create a draft report using `assets/review_report_template.md`.
8. Run `scripts/validate_review_report.py` on the report.
9. If validation fails, repair the report and validate again.
10. Stop and present the report to the human reviewer.

## Safety / Boundaries
- Read-only review of GitHub/repository content.
- Do not modify production code unless explicitly starting a new task.
- Do not comment, approve or merge Pull Requests.
- Do not weaken tests to remove findings.
- Stop if REQUIREMENTS.md and SPEC.md conflict.

## Output
Create:
results/pr-readiness-review.md

The report must distinguish:
- MUST FIX
- SHOULD FIX
- OPTIONAL
- Human decision required
